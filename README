isolate - mini-containers

Usage: isolate [options] [--] command [args...]

Run `command` with a modified view of the world.  Not intended for
protection from malicious code, just for preventing things from
mucking around where they shouldn't.

Network modification:
  --(no-)isolate-net - Remove all network devices except the loopback.
Filesystem modification:
  --hide - Replace with an empty directory.
  --share - Replace file/directory with the actual version.  Generally used
            for subdirectories of a --hide.
  --readonly - Make file/directory read-only view of the actual version.
  --copy - Replace directory with a copy of the actual version (on a tmpfs).
Other:
  --config file - Source a config file.  The file can set the bash variables:
    command=( command [args...] )
    isolate_net=yes|no
    isolate_fs=( hide dir1 share dir2 ... )

If isolate is invoked using a different name, it looks for a `.conf`
file sharing that name in the directory the isolate script is in.
That file is sourced as if passed to --config.  No command line
processing is performed and all options are passed through to the
wrapped command (which should be specified in the config file).
